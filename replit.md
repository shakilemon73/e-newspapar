## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Build Tool**: Vite for optimized builds.
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Bengali font support.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state.
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom hooks.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Mobile-first responsive design, Bangladesh-specific cultural color psychology (green, red, white), 44px minimum touch targets, professional Bengali typography (SolaimanLipi, Kalpurush, Noto Sans Bengali), minimalistic design principles, WCAG AA compliance for accessibility.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server (minimal frontend-only server; direct Supabase calls preferred).
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with real-time capabilities.
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle ORM configuration (PostgreSQL dialect).
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with comprehensive CRUD operations, with a strong emphasis on direct Supabase API calls.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration with JWT tokens.

### System Design Choices
- **Content Management System**: Full CRUD for articles, hierarchical categories, digital newspaper editions (E-Papers) with LaTeX/PDF support, video content management, and audio articles.

- **Administrative Features**: Comprehensive admin dashboard, real-time analytics, user management with roles/permissions, and content moderation.
- **Data Flow**: Content published through admin dashboard, stored in Supabase; user interactions tracked for analytics and recommendations; search and discovery use PostgreSQL full-text search and AI algorithms for trending topics.
- **AI Integration**: Backend AI processing using TensorFlow.js and Hugging Face Transformers for Bengali text summarization, sentiment analysis, automatic tagging, and reading time calculation. AI analysis is dynamic and research-based, integrated into discovery widgets and reading stats.
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies across 38 tables, role-based access control, JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, input validation with Zod schemas, and secure environment variable management.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Code splitting, image optimization (WebP), database indexing (17 indexes), and caching strategies (TanStack Query, Supabase real-time updates).
- **Deployment Strategy**: Frontend static site generation (Vite) deployed on Vercel/Netlify; backend (minimal Express) on Node.js hosting; Supabase for production database.
