Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
The backend uses a Node.js/Express server with Supabase database:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Supabase client for database operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for user management
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling and middleware

### Database Design
Uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management via Supabase Auth

### Server-Side Flow
1. Express server handles API requests
2. Authentication middleware validates user sessions
3. Supabase client manages database operations
4. Response data formatted and sent to client

### Database Operations

## Recent Changes (January 15, 2025)

### Fixed Disabled API Functions with Supabase Integration (January 15, 2025)
✓ Enabled reading history tracking API (POST /api/track-reading)
✓ Enabled reading history retrieval API (GET /api/reading-history)
✓ Enabled personalized recommendations API (GET /api/personalized-recommendations)
✓ Updated APIs to handle missing tables gracefully with proper error handling

**Database Setup Instructions:**
To complete the setup, run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the following commands:

```sql
-- Create reading_history table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reading_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  article_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_read_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  read_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, article_id)
);

-- Create saved_articles table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS saved_articles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  article_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  saved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, article_id)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reading_history_user_id ON reading_history(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reading_history_article_id ON reading_history(article_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reading_history_last_read_at ON reading_history(last_read_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_articles_user_id ON saved_articles(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_articles_article_id ON saved_articles(article_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_saved_articles_saved_at ON saved_articles(saved_at);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE reading_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE saved_articles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies for reading_history
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can view own reading history" ON reading_history
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can insert own reading history" ON reading_history
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can update own reading history" ON reading_history
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can delete own reading history" ON reading_history
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create RLS policies for saved_articles
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can view own saved articles" ON saved_articles
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can insert own saved articles" ON saved_articles
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Users can delete own saved articles" ON saved_articles
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Once these tables are created, all reading history and personalized recommendations will work automatically.
