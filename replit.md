### Backend Architecture
The backend uses a Node.js/Express server with Supabase database:
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Supabase client for database operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for user management
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling and middleware

### Database Design
Uses Supabase PostgreSQL with the following main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and profile management via Supabase Auth
