# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide - Bengali News Website

## ✅ Fixed All Vercel Configuration Issues

Both deployment errors have been **completely resolved**:

1. ✅ **"functions/builds conflict"** - Removed conflicting `builds` property
2. ✅ **"routes cannot be present with rewrites/headers"** - Removed conflicting `routes` property

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Removed conflicting `builds` property** from `vercel.json`
2. **Removed conflicting `routes` property** - Using modern `rewrites` instead
3. **Streamlined configuration** for Vercel's latest requirements
4. **Optimized serverless functions** with proper runtime settings
5. **Enhanced API routing** using `rewrites` for better performance
6. **Added proper CORS headers** for cross-origin requests
