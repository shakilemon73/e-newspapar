Understanding the problem
The error message Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON indicates that the code is attempting to parse a string using JSON.parse(), but the string it received is not valid JSON. Specifically, the error message shows that the string being parsed is "[object Object]". This string is the default string representation of a JavaScript object, not a valid JSON string.

This typically happens when an object is implicitly converted to a string in a context where a JSON string is expected. In the provided code, the _storageChangeDispatcher function iterates over the keys of an event object (e) and attempts to parse e[t].oldValue and e[t].newValue as JSON. It seems that for one of the keys (t), the oldValue or newValue is a JavaScript object that has been coerced into the string "[object Object]", which is not a valid input for JSON.parse().

Suggested fix
Before attempting to parse the value with JSON.parse(), ensure that the value is a string. You can add a check to see if e[t].oldValue or e[t].newValue is a string before calling JSON.parse(). If it's not a string, you might need to handle that case differently, perhaps by converting the object to a JSON string using JSON.stringify() if it is indeed meant to represent data that can be serialized as JSON, or by skipping the parsing if it's not expected to be a JSON string.

Here's a suggested modification to the _storageChangeDispatcher function:

js

_storageChangeDispatcher(e,t){
  for(const t of Object.keys(e)){
    let n, r;
    // Check if oldValue is a string before parsing
    if (typeof e[t].oldValue === 'string') {
      try {
        n = JSON.parse(e[t].oldValue);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to parse oldValue as JSON:", e[t].oldValue, error);
        // Handle the parsing error, perhaps by setting n to null or a default value
        n = null;
      }
    } else {
      // Handle cases where oldValue is not a string (e.g., an object)
      // Depending on expected data, you might stringify or handle as non-JSON
      n = e[t].oldValue; // Or handle appropriately
    }

    // Check if newValue is a string before parsing
    if (typeof e[t].newValue === 'string') {
      try {
        r = JSON.parse(e[t].newValue);
      } catch (error) {
         console.error("Failed to parse newValue as JSON:", e[t].newValue, error);
         // Handle the parsing error
         r = null;
      }
    } else {
       // Handle cases where newValue is not a string
       r = e[t].newValue; // Or handle appropriately
    }


    (null==n?void 0:n.value)!==(null==r?void 0:r.value)&&this.callListeners(t,e[t].newValue)
  }
}

Use code snippets with caution

This code adds typeof e[t].oldValue === 'string' and typeof e[t].newValue === 'string' checks before attempting to parse. It also includes try...catch blocks to handle potential parsing errors gracefully, logging the problematic value and the error. You may need to adjust how you handle non-string values based on the expected data format.

Summary
The error SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON occurs because JSON.parse() was called with the string "[object Object]", which is not valid JSON. This string likely resulted from attempting to parse a JavaScript object that was implicitly converted to its string representation. The fix involves verifying that the input to JSON.parse() is a string before parsing and handling cases where it is not.
