I'll help you find the error in the browser console for your e-newspaper app. Let me fetch the page and examine it.It seems the page returned empty content. This itself could be indicating an error. Let me search for common issues with Vercel deployments using Supabase to help identify potential problems:Based on the search results and the fact that your page returned empty content, here are the most common browser console errors you might be encountering with a Vercel + Supabase deployment:

## Common Console Errors and Solutions:

### 1. **Environment Variables Issues**
- **Error**: `Supabase URL is not defined` or `Supabase Anon Key is not defined`
- **Solution**: Make sure your environment variables are properly set in Vercel:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 2. **Database Connection Errors**
- **Error**: `Failed to fetch` or `Network Error`
- **Solution**: Check that your Supabase URL and Service Role Key are correctly set as environment variables, and ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is properly configured

### 3. **Authentication Errors**
- **Error**: `Auth session missing` or `Invalid JWT`
- **Solution**: This often happens after deployment when authentication works in development but fails in production

### 4. **CORS Issues**
- **Error**: `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`
- **Solution**: Add your Vercel domain to Supabase's allowed origins

### 5. **Build/Deployment Errors**
- **Error**: Empty page or white screen
- **Solution**: Check your build logs in Vercel dashboard for compilation errors

## To Debug Your Specific Issue:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open Developer Tools → Console tab
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed requests
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: In Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
4. **Check Supabase Dashboard**: Verify your project is active and API keys are correct
