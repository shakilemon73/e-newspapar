Explanation

Understanding the problem
This ReferenceError: jsx is not defined in the console indicates that your code is attempting to use a variable or construct named jsx that has not been declared or is not accessible in the current scope [3]. In the context of web development, jsx typically refers to JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension commonly used with libraries like React to describe UI components [1].

The error suggests that the JavaScript code, likely a bundled file like main-BrX-3j1l.js, contains JSX syntax that the JavaScript environment is trying to interpret directly without a proper transformation step [1]. This transformation is usually handled by a build process (like Babel or esbuild) that converts JSX into standard JavaScript function calls (e.g., React.createElement).

The error occurring in a minified or bundled file (main-BrX-3j1l.js) makes it harder to pinpoint the exact location in your source code, but it strongly suggests an issue with how your project is building or processing JSX [1].

Suggested fix
Ensure that your project's build process is correctly configured to handle JSX. This typically involves using a tool like Babel with the appropriate presets (@babel/preset-react or @babel/preset-env with the react preset enabled) to transform JSX into standard JavaScript [1].

If you are using a framework like Create React App, Next.js, or a similar build setup, this configuration is usually handled automatically. If the error appeared unexpectedly, consider if any build dependencies or configurations have changed recently [1].

If you have a custom build setup, verify that your build tool (e.g., Webpack, Rollup, esbuild) is configured to use Babel or another JSX transformer on your JavaScript and/or TypeScript files.

If you are using a library or framework that recently updated, it's possible the issue is related to changes in how that library handles or requires JSX processing [1]. Check the documentation or release notes for the library for any relevant information.

Summary
The ReferenceError: jsx is not defined means your browser's JavaScript environment is trying to execute JSX syntax directly. This happens because the JSX hasn't been transformed into standard JavaScript during the build process. The solution is to ensure your project's build pipeline correctly processes JSX, typically using a tool like Babel [1].
