Understanding the problem
The error Uncaught ReferenceError: jsx is not defined means that the JavaScript code is trying to use a variable or function named jsx, but it hasn't been declared or defined anywhere that the code can access it. This is a common issue in web development when using libraries like React, which utilize JSX syntax [1].

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML and is used within React to describe what the UI should look like. While JSX looks like HTML, it's not directly understood by web browsers. It needs to be transformed into regular JavaScript function calls (like React.createElement()) before the browser can execute it [5].

The ReferenceError: jsx is not defined typically indicates that this transformation process hasn't happened correctly, or that the runtime environment where the code is being executed doesn't have the necessary definitions for jsx or the underlying functions that the transformed JSX would call. This can happen if:

The build process (using tools like Babel or esbuild) that converts JSX to JavaScript is not configured correctly or failed.
A required library (like React) is not loaded or accessible in the environment where the code is running.
There's a problem with how the JavaScript bundles are being created or served.
Suggested fix
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that your build process correctly transforms JSX into valid JavaScript and that the necessary runtime libraries (like React) are available. Here are a few common steps to take:

Check your build configuration: If you are using a build tool like Webpack, Parcel, or esbuild, verify that your configuration includes a step to process JSX files (typically using a Babel or similar loader/plugin). Ensure that the configuration is targeting the correct files and directories.
Ensure React is included: Make sure that React and ReactDOM are included as dependencies in your project and are being loaded on the page where the error occurs.
Update dependencies: Sometimes, this error can occur due to version conflicts or bugs in libraries [1]. Try updating your project dependencies, especially React and any related build tools, to their latest compatible versions.
Clear cache and rebuild: Cached build artifacts can sometimes cause unexpected issues. Try clearing your build cache and running the build process again.
Examine the generated code: If possible, inspect the main-BrX-3j1l.js file at the specified line (1207:11048) to see the context where jsx is being referenced. This might provide more clues about what's happening.
Summary
The Uncaught ReferenceError: jsx is not defined error means that the browser is encountering JSX syntax that hasn't been correctly transformed into standard JavaScript. This is usually a problem with the build process not properly converting the JSX or with missing runtime dependencies like React. Fixing this involves checking your build configuration, ensuring React is included, and potentially updating project dependencies.
