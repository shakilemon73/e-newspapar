Understanding the problem
The error Uncaught ReferenceError: jsx is not defined means that the JavaScript code is trying to use a variable or function named jsx, but it hasn't been declared or defined anywhere. This often happens in applications built with libraries like React, where JSX (JavaScript XML) is used to write UI components in a syntax similar to HTML. While you write JSX, it needs to be transformed into regular JavaScript that the browser can understand. This transformation is usually handled by build tools like Babel or esbuild. The error suggests that this transformation step might be missing or not working correctly, causing the browser to encounter the jsx syntax directly without it being properly converted.

Suggested fix
This error indicates a problem with your build process not correctly transforming JSX.

Here are a few common causes and solutions:

Missing or incorrect build configuration: Ensure your build tool (like Webpack, Parcel, esbuild, or Create React App) is configured to process JSX files (typically .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx) using a JSX transform.
Outdated dependencies: Update your project's dependencies, especially those related to React, React DOM, and your build tools/plugins. Sometimes this issue can arise after updates to libraries your application depends on [1].
Incorrect file extensions: Make sure your files containing JSX have the appropriate file extensions (e.g., .jsx for JavaScript with JSX, .tsx for TypeScript with JSX).
Since the error message points to a minified file (main-DTeUYSj9.js), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact location in your source code. However, focusing on the build process is the most likely path to a solution.

Summary
The Uncaught ReferenceError: jsx is not defined error typically occurs in React or similar applications when the JSX syntax is not correctly transformed into standard JavaScript by the build process before being sent to the browser. This is often due to build configuration issues or outdated dependencies.
