# Comprehensive UX/UI Problems List - Admin Dashboard
## Based on Nielsen Norman Group, Material Design, Luke Wroblewski & Industry Research

### üö® CRITICAL PROBLEMS (Immediate Action Required)

#### 1. **Overwhelming Navigation Complexity**
- **Problem**: 25+ navigation items across 6 categories violates Miller's Rule (7¬±2)
- **Evidence**: Nielsen Norman Group research on cognitive load
- **Current Impact**: Users can't find features quickly, high cognitive load
- **Solution**: Reduce to 6 main categories with progressive disclosure

#### 2. **Language Rendering Performance Issue** 
- **Problem**: API calls taking 2000-2300ms causing UI freezing
- **Evidence**: Performance logs show slow operations
- **Current Impact**: Poor user experience, perceived broken interface
- **Solution**: Implement caching, lazy loading, skeleton states

#### 3. **Non-Organized Field Groups**
- **Problem**: Settings form lacks proper field grouping
- **Evidence**: Material Design guidelines on form organization
- **Current Impact**: Confusing form interaction, high form abandonment risk
- **Solution**: Card-based field grouping with clear sections

#### 4. **Mobile-First Violations**
- **Problem**: Touch targets below 44px, desktop-first design
- **Evidence**: Luke Wroblewski's mobile-first principles
- **Current Impact**: Poor mobile usability, accessibility issues
- **Solution**: Redesign with mobile-first approach

#### 5. **Insufficient Visual Hierarchy**
- **Problem**: All navigation items same visual weight
- **Evidence**: Gestalt principles, NN/g visual design research
- **Current Impact**: Users can't distinguish primary from secondary actions
- **Solution**: 3-level typography hierarchy with clear importance
