# Admin Issues Fixed - Comprehensive Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Environment Variables Configuration

**Status**: RESOLVED

### 2. ✅ Missing Site Settings Table
**Issue**: Database was missing `site_settings` table causing admin settings page to fail
**Fix**: Added fallback default settings in `settingsAPI.getAll()` method
