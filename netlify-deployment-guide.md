# Netlify Deployment Guide for Bengali News Website

## The Problem
You're seeing "নিবন্ধ লোড করতে সমস্যা হয়েছে" (article loading error) because:

1. **This is a Full-Stack App**: Your project has both frontend (React) and backend (Express server)
2. **Netlify is Static Hosting**: Netlify only hosts static frontend files, not Express servers
3. **Missing API Server**: The frontend tries to call `/api/*` endpoints that don't exist on Netlify

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy Frontend Only to Netlify (Recommended)
Deploy only the React frontend and use Supabase directly from the browser:

1. **Modify frontend to use Supabase directly**:
   - Remove API calls to `/api/categories`, `/api/articles`, etc.
   - Call Supabase directly from React components
   - Use `@supabase/supabase-js` client-side

2. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Upload the 'dist' folder to Netlify
   ```

3. **Set environment variables in Netlify**:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://mrjukcqspvhketnfzmud.supabase.co
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [your anon key]

### Option 2: Deploy Full-Stack to Vercel/Railway (Better Choice)
Since you have a backend server, use platforms that support Node.js:

#### Vercel Deployment:
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy - it will automatically handle both frontend and backend

#### Railway Deployment:
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Set environment variables
3. Deploy with one click

### Option 3: Use Netlify Functions (Advanced)
Convert your Express routes to Netlify Functions:
- Create `.netlify/functions/` folder
- Convert each route to a serverless function
- More complex but keeps you on Netlify

## Current Netlify Configuration Issue
Your `netlify.toml` tries to redirect API calls to functions that don't exist:
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server/:splat"  # This function doesn't exist
```

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Switch to Vercel**: It's designed for full-stack apps like yours
2. **Or modify the app**: Remove the Express server and use Supabase directly
3. **Keep Netlify**: Convert Express routes to Netlify Functions
