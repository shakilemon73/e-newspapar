# JWT Token Expiration Fix

## Issue
The application is experiencing "JWT expired" errors across all Supabase API calls. This happens when authentication tokens expire and need to be refreshed.

## Root Cause
Supabase JWT tokens have a limited lifespan and need to be refreshed automatically. The current implementation doesn't handle token refresh properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Supabase Client Configuration
- Updated `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` with better auth configuration
- Added automatic token refresh settings
- Added proper error handling

### 2. JWT Refresh Handler
- Created `handleJWTError()` function to automatically refresh expired tokens
- Automatically retries failed requests after token refresh
- Provides graceful fallback for persistent errors

### 3. Updated API Functions  
- Modified all API functions to use the new JWT refresh handler
- Added proper error handling and retry logic
- Maintains user experience during token refresh

## Current Status
- Fixed JWT expiration handling in core API functions
- Token refresh now happens automatically when needed
- Users should no longer see "JWT expired" errors in console

## Usage
The fix is automatic - no user intervention required. The system will:
1. Detect JWT expired errors
2. Automatically refresh the session
3. Retry the original request
4. Continue normal operation

## Files Modified
- `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Enhanced client configuration
- `client/src/lib/supabase-api-direct.ts` - Added JWT refresh handling
- Core API functions updated with automatic retry logic
